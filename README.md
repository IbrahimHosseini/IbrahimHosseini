## Experiences üî¨
- Maintained a large-scale application using **protocol-oriented programming** and **clean Architecture principles**.
- Designed a navigation solution utilizing the **Coordinator architecture** to reduce code within the view controller, achieving a more reusable approach to navigation between views.
- Spearheaded and developed the project utilizing **RxSwift** and **MVVM** architecture.
- Managing data using **Realm** database and **Keychain**.
- Restructured the table view to efficiently display 300+ images fetched from the gallery, resulting in a **significant improvement in loading times** and user experience.
- Identified and addressed **memory leaks**, leading to a 20% improvement in app responsiveness.
- Optimized image size through regeneration using **ImageIO**, resulting in faster user upload and download speeds, and **reduced cloud storage** costs for improved customer satisfaction.
- Enhanced code maintainability and achieved a 30% reduction in complexity by implementing **dependency injection** and clean architecture principles.
- Translated complex UI features from **Figma** design into functional and user-friendly app experiences through programmatic implementation.
- Implemented the hub offline feature in the app by utilizing **RxSwift** to listen for relevant events and update the UI accordingly.
- Contributed to successful project outcomes by collaborating closely with designers, front-end developers, and Product Managers throughout the development process.
- Leveraged development tools like **GitLab**, **Git**, and **Jira** to successfully manage the application's development in a globally distributed **Agile** environment.
- Implemented **Web3** architecture to enable secure import and creation of **cryptocurrency** wallets within the application.
- Developed and deployed a **real-time chat** program using **Socket.io**, resulting in increased user engagement by 20%, fostering a more interactive and collaborative online community.
- Implemented clustering on **Google Maps** to display upcoming concerts and artists, resulting in a 10% increase in user interactions with the app.
- Implemented **push notifications** by creating and integrating an **APNS** certificate with **Firebase**. Streamlined user experience by displaying all notices within a dedicated Notifications Tab. Ensured seamless server integration for efficient push notification handling.
- Leveraged mobile **analytics platforms** like **Firebase** and **Mixpanel** to delve into user behavior within our social media app. This facilitated the personalization of in-app experiences and the optimization of user journeys, leading to a remarkable 40% increase in user retention.
- Works with **iBeacon** to connect some Bluetooth devices to an iPhone. In addition, by using [Manhatan distance](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html#:~:text=Definition%3A%20The%20distance%20between%20two,y1%20%2D%20y2%7C.) formula, calculate the location of a user on a vehicle and then manage the user device using **MDM** with [Hexnode](https://www.hexnode.com).
- Develop a **SwiftPM** to manage the System State (**RAM**, **CPU**, **GPU**, **Network**, **Disk**) and embedded to the project. It caused the reduction of more than thousands of lines of code, also **preventing code duplication** and making it simpler to **scalable** and **maintain**.
