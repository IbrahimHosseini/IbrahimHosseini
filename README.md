- **Intermediate:** `SwiftUI`, `Combine`, `RxSwift`, `Unit Test`, `Integration Test`, Fastlane, GitLab CI, `Realm`
- **Basic:** `The Composable Architecture`, Objective‐C, React Native, UI/UX (Figma, Adobe XD)
- **Language:** Persian, English

## Work Experiences 🔬
- Initiated, planned, and worked on the project with `RxSwift` and `MVVM` architecture.
- Storing data using Realm database and Keychain.
- Maintained an application using protocol‐oriented programming and clean Architecture principles.
- Designed a navigation solution using the `Coordinator architecture` to reduce the code in the view controller and has a reusable way to navigate between views.
- Restructured the table view to show 300+ images fetched from the gallery.
- Solved the memory leaks in the app, which caused the app to work smoothly.
- Reduce the image sizing by regeneration images using ImageIO; it causes the users to have faster uploading and downloading. In addition, customers are satisfied due to using less storage in the cloud.
- Implemented `dependency injection` and `clean architecture`, resulting in a 30 percent reduction in code complexity and improved maintainability.
- Worked on the implementation of complex UI features of applications based on the UI/UX document (Figma) programmatically.
- Incorporated the hub offline feature in the app by listening for events within the using Reactive programming(RxSwift) and updating UI accordingly.
- Collaborate with designers, front-end developers, and product managers.
- Worked with development tools like Gitalab, Git, and Jira to develop the application in a globally distributed Agile development environment.
- Designed push notifications in the app with APNS and Firebase to communicate with customers.
