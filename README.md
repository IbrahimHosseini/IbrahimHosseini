## Summary 😎
I have experience as an iOS developer with 7+ years of background in iOS design and development across diverse industries. Experience in software design and architecture like `MVC`, and `MVVM`. Write testable and maintainable code in Swift, and also familiar with `Objective‐C`. `Excellent communication`, and organizational skills with attention to detail. Fast learner, highly motivated, and keen to use new technologies.

## Skills ⛷️
- **Advanced Knowledge:** `Swift`, Git, UIKit, `SOLID`, `Clean Code`, RESTful APIs, Auto Layout
- **Intermediate:** `SwiftUI`, `Combine`, `RxSwift`, `Unit Test`, `Integration Test`, Fastlane, GitLab CI, `Realm`
- **Basic:** `The Composable Architecture`, Objective‐C, React Native, UI/UX (Figma, Adobe XD)
- **Language:** Persian, English

## Work Experiences 🔬
- Initiated, planned, and worked on the project with `RxSwift` and `MVVM` architecture.
- Storing data using Realm database and Keychain.
- Maintained an application using `protocol‐oriented programming` and clean Architecture principles.
- Designed a navigation solution using the `Coordinator architecture` to reduce the code in the view controller and has a reusable way to navigate between views.
- Restructured the table view to show 300+ images fetched from the gallery.
- Solved the `memory leaks` in the app, which caused the app to work smoothly.
- Reduce the image sizing by regeneration images using `ImageIO`; it causes the users to have faster uploading and downloading. In addition, customers are satisfied due to using less storage in the cloud.
- Implemented `dependency injection` and `clean architecture`, resulting in a 30 percent reduction in code complexity and improved maintainability.
- Worked on implementing complex UI features of applications based on the `UI/UX` document (Figma) programmatically.
- Incorporated the hub offline feature in the app by listening for events using `Reactive programming`(RxSwift) and updating UI accordingly.
- `Collaborate` with designers, front-end developers, and product managers.
- Worked with development tools like `Gitalab`, Git, and `Jira` to develop the application in a globally distributed `Agile` development environment.
- Designed `push notifications` in the app with `APNS` and `Firebase` to communicate with customers.
